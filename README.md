# Rust Web Server

Experimental web server based on the [final chapter of 'The Rust Programming Language' book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html).

This project serves as a playground of sorts for myself, don't expect this to work beyond the most basic of use cases.
